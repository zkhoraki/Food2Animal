<h2 class="headers"> <center>About the Website </center></h2>
  <p class="paras"> <center>Lets say you are on a pick with your friends and family, and you have some left over corn that you are too full to eat. Lets also say that there is a squirrel by you eyeing the corn. You don't know if a squirrel can have corn or not, so you search it up. When you search it up, you can't find anything on it, or you can't find a trustworthy source, and you are just getting tired. So, at the end you don't find an answer, and you don't even know if a squirrel can eat corn or not, so you end up not feeding the corn to the squirrel. </center></p>

  <p class="paras"> <center>But, with this website, if you search up the food you are wondering a animal can have or not, it will tell you what animals can not eat that food. So you don't have to sit there searching for hours if an animal can eat the food or not, and you are keeping the animal safe by searching the food up. </center></P>
